The website includes a detailed image of the wasp with annotations for different body parts such as the head, thorax, abdomen, wings, and legs. Each annotation is accompanied by a description explaining the function or purpose of that body part. The website is designed to be educational, providing a visually engaging way for users to learn about the anatomy of a wasp.
